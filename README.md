# OS workshops

## Cross Compiler

To compile the OS for the CPU, we need a cross compiler, a cross linker, etc.. It allows us to compile for another target than the OS.

We have made a Docker image, to build and run it, run the next instructions:


```bash

```

You can build it by hand from this source https://wiki.osdev.org/GCC_Cross-Compiler.
